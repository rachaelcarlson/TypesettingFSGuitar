* Potential Tasks for this Project
** TODO Add part for typesetting and editorial conventions for finger-style guitar scores
  - I think that this should be one of the primary goals of this
    book. I think that it should be the first part of this book.
* Thoughts on LilyPond Part
  - How should I break up this part into its component parts?
  - How does one actually start a new LilyPond Document with the aim
    of creating a finger-style guitar score?
  -
